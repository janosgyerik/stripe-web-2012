Stripe Web 2012
===============
Source codes of the challenges in the 'Capture the Flag 2.0' by @stripe.

This repository is for my friends who joined too late.

The contest organizers promised to release the source codes soon. I will update this README when they do, at which point this repo will become quite pointless.

There are no hints and solutions here, so you're completely on your own. Well, almost. I added the original introductory messages that were on the contest website but not included with the source code. See the info.txt file in each folder. Read them well, as they have instructions and hints(!) for each challenge.

Enjoy!
